##### A Java program that goes through six different Disk sorting algorithms

A program that tests the efficiency of different disk sorting algorithms by creating a disk drive with 5000 cylinders and takes in 1000 random requests from the aforementioned cylinders. It takes in the initial position of the disk head and runs through six disk sorting algorithms, FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK and CLOOK, returning the total head movement count for each sort.
