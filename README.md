Created as a group project with:
- Kenneth Lam
- [Ricky Chon](https://github.com/RickyC0626)
- Michael Odusanya
- [Rabe Datta](https://github.com/RabeDatta)

What started as a Pictionary multiplayer game turned into a real time code sharing service. Created as a Hackathon project for Major League Hacking, this program allows users to choose a username, chat to one another, write code in a text field which is updated real time to let others see it as well. Also has a hand drawn jukebox which plays music when clicked on. Multiple users can write code and share the text field. Created using React hooks, socket.io, javascript, html, and deployed with Heroku.
